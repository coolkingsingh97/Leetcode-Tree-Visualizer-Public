# Leetcode-Tree-Visualizer-Public

This project is built using the MERN stack.

## Problem:

When doing tree questions,leetcode gives a couple of example cases of the tree and their visualizations.

Occasionally some edge test cases don’t pass and they have alot 

As you see above the long array above takes too frustratingly long to visualize in a notebook. 

I thought to myself there has got to be some app out there that can help visualize this.

 While there are a bunch of binary tree visualizers like the below, they helpful but not easy to implement.

Python package by gavinhub
This GraphViz tool by lonerinthenight
This app http://btv.melezinek.cz/ but this was only for BST’s and seemed overly slow.
This website is also too slow and manual https://www.datastructurex.com/ 

This website allows you to easily test and visualize your edge cases to see where you are going wrong.

To run this website you will need:
1. Mongo DB atlas cluster
2. Node
3. Node packages mentioned in the package.json file.
